# marcus-utilities
**A bunch of minimal, no-nonsense tools. In HTML.**

No installs. No logins. No ads. Just utilities that *work.*

# What’s this even for?

Because sometimes, you just want simple tools that open instantly — not “apps” that demand your soul and 300MB of RAM.  

Here’s what Marcus’s Utilities is good for:

- 🧰 **Everyday Essentials** – Calculators, clocks, etc — all in HTML.  
- 💡 **Quick Access Anywhere** – Like you could be in prison right now and use this thing on a prison laptop 
- 🪞 **Minimalist Experiments** – Each tool focuses on one thing. Cleanly. Efficiently. Beautifully.
